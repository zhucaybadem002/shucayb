        Independence Day Somaliland
     </p>
    </h1>
    <h2>
        On 26 June 1960, British Somaliland gained independence as the State of Somaliland. On 1 July, the country united with the former Italian Somaliland to become the Somali Republic. The anniversaries of both events are now celebrated as public holidays in Somaliland and Somalia.[2]

On 18 May 1991, a revived Republic of Somaliland "reaffirmed" sovereignty over State of Somaliland[4] from the Somali Democratic Republic. Since 1991, Somaliland has been a self-declared sovereign state that is recognised as an autonomous independent region of Somalia by the international community. Its government regards its territory as the successor state to the State of Somaliland, and seeks full international recognition as the Republic of Somaliland.Wrote by Kawlo [5]
